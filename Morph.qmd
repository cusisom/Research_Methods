# Morphometrics Workflow {#sec-morphometrics}

**This folder stores multiple components of my data acquisition and data analysis workflow. For an overview of how this project will use 3D slicer to collect Geometric Morphometric data, read through the `Slicer Workflow` section. This Workflow includes how to run the General Procustes Analysis `GPA`. Primary analysis, however, will be run through the `R Statistical Software` Information on how this is accomplished can be found in the `Analysis` folder. All of the raw data for this part of my project can be found in the `Data` folder.**
