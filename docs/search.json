Click this once to change to 36)\n\n\n\nSet the camera to Av\n\nSet the White Balance to Color Temperature (hit the Q menu button and scroll through options until you see white balance)\nSet camera to Manual Focus\n\nPlace specimen in the center of the turntable\n\nUse a stand/ring mold\nIf this is a skull, set the beginning position as close to Frankfurt horizontal as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocus camera on specimen. For best precision, use the magnifying glass button on camera to zoom over focused region.\nOnce all settings are in place, press the orange button on the foldio app to begin shooting.\n\nDo not close the app or return to home screen on phone. This will stop the process.\n\nWait until all 36 photos have been taken. Then rotate antero-superiorly (rotate along sagittal plane)\n\nTo capture all need angles you will need to reposition the skull about 6 times, rotating it approximately 30 degrees in the sagittal plane each time. Your last set of photos should be shot with the frontal bone positioned in the ring mold.\n\nRemove the memory card from the camera and load into Adobe Lightroom on computer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo view photos, click on import and choose the USB drive\n\nFind DCIM under 100 Canon\nMake sure that only the photos that you want imported are selected\nClick Import\n\nOnce photos are imported, click on Develop in top right corner\n\nThis will open full view of first photo in the list\n\nClick on the eyedropper icon on the right side of the screen and then click on the photo\n\nFrom this window you can also adjust the Texture and Temp of the file. Increase a bit for more detail but not so much that it begins to highlight details other than the crania (e.g., aspects of the turntable or specimen stand)\n\nWhen settings are as you want them, click on Copy in the bottom left corner. Click Ok on the menu that pops up.\n\nThen hold control and press ‘a’ to select the entire library.\nClick Sync in the bottom right corner to apply to all\n\nAnother pop-up window will appear. Click Ok to sync\n\nYou can switch back to library view from the menu in the top right corner to see if Lightroom is applying your changes to all photos.\n\nWhen complete, hit Export in bottom left corner and choose a folder to send the images.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Reality Capture\nUnder Workflow in the ribbon on top should have an icon that says Folder, click on this and select the folder that your exported photos are in.\nCheck to see that the images loaded by observing the image count in the window on the left of the screen\nClick on the Alignment tab in the ribbon and find/click on the Align Images button\n\nWait while the program creates your model\n\nThe resulting image can vary in its presentation. In any case, it will look like a pixelated model of your specimen. If it looks like your specimen in multiple views (i.e., the images didn’t create one cohesive model) you will need to add more photos or begin the process again. If the images come together to create what looks like a good rendition of the specimen you can move on.\n\n\nTo orient the model, click on the Tools button in the SCENE 3D ribbon. At the very left of the ribbon menu there are two buttons for setting the Reconstruction Region and the Ground Plane. Begin by clicking Set Ground Plane\n\nYou will observe three colored rings and three colored bars appear within your model.\nClicking on any of the colored rings will allow you to rotate your model. Do this until it is in proper anatomical position (for crania, position in Frankfurt Horizontal).\nOnce in the correct position, click on the vertical colored bar to drag the model up to place on the ground plane.\nIf importing this into 3D Slicer (which we will for this purpose), you will want to orient the image backwords (i.e., when viewed from the front, you are looking at the back). This can be checked by opening the View menu under the Scene 3D tab and finding the View Camera box. The default setting is on Perspective which will be used for orienting the specimens. Click on this to see the dropdown menu and select Front. Adjust the orientation until this view shows the back of the specimen.\n\nClick on the Set Reconstruction Region tab in the top left menu\n\nA bounding box will appear around your model. Make sure that this box encompasses your entire model (nothing outside the box)\n\nSetting Scale\n\nOnce the model is properly oriented, move to establishing the correct scale.\nUnder the Tools tab in SCENE 3D, click on the Control Points tab\nA menu will appear on the left of the screen\nClick on the button that says Control Points in this menu and then select Create\n\nIt will generate an unassigned point (point 0)\n\nA small pop-up window will appear in the upper right corner of your screen suggesting that control points be assigned in 2D mode. Heed this advice.\n\nNear where this pop-up appeared (top right of model viewer screen) is a small white box that reads 3Ds. Click and hold this button to access the dropdown menu.\nOpen the 2Ds library\nImportant. You will need to choose at least 2 different photos to set the control points. If you pressed Test Connection on the foldio app when taking photos, you will likely have at least two copies of the first image. Do not use the duplicate shot when setting control points.\nClick on the first image you want to use and open the drop down menu again.\n\nClick on 2D, to view this image\nClick on the point 0 button that generated earlier. You can now place this point on your image.\nAfter this point is placed, generate another unassigned point by clicking create. This will give you ‘point 1’\nSelect this unassigned point and place it on the image.\n\nThere is no protocol yet for what points to use. I am using the nasal height as my metric for setting scale. Thus, I am setting point 0 at Nasion, and point 1 at the tip of the anterior nasal spine\n\nReturn to the 2Ds library and click on the second image. Being sure to select the correct points (first point 0, then point 1), assign the points to the corresponding positions on this image.\n\nTo set your scale, you will first need to know the distance between these two points. Collect this distance manually on the physical specimen with sliding calipers.\nIn Reality Capture, under Tools in the SCENE 3D menu, select Define Distance\n\nClick on point 0 in one of your 2D images and drag to point 1\nA box will appear in the menu on the left of your screen (Selected Constraint(s))\nReality Capture will provide you with a Defined Distance that does not look accurate. Delete the number provided for you and type in the measurement that you collected manually.\nNote that Reality Capture insists on the scale being in meters. If your measurement is in Millimeters (should be), make sure to properly convert the measurement.\n\n\nOnce your distance is defined, go back to the Alignment Menu from the top ribbon.\n\nClick on Update\nIf everything went right, this will quickly update the scale for your model\n\n\nFinishing the Model\n\nTo finish the model making process, return to the Mesh Model menu\nClick on the Normal Detail button.\nThis will take a minute\n\nWhen complete, a matte white model will be provided\nLook over the model to ensure that all aspects of your specimen are visible\nIf the model includes foreign objects (e.g., parts of the stand), use the Lasso tool provided in the Tools menu under the Scene 3D ribbon.Use this tool to highlight the unwanted objects and click on Filter Selection to remove.\n\nWith the model completed, we want to compress the file for more efficient computing down the line. This step may or may not be necessary depending on the computing power of the processor being used. Thus, it is a part of our workflow but possibly unnecessary for others. To accomplish this, click on the Simplify button in the same Tools menu. We simplify the Target Triangle Count to 200,000 (Observe the Simplify Tool menu that appears on the left side of the screen).\n\nClick Simplify at the bottom of the menu\n\n\nTexturize and Export\n\nWith the model completed and simplified, we want to apply the appropriate texture. This can be done by selecting Texture under the Mesh Model menu.\nWith each step completed we can now export the model to be analyzed in 3D Slicer'      - While in the same menu, selectDense Mesh Modelfrom theExportbox      - Choose the Folder to save it in (*We create a new folder for each specimen*)      PressOkwhen theExport Model` window pops up"
