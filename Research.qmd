## Project Context

The Late Middle Pleistocene spans from approximatly 350 Ka to 100 ka 
and is characterized by `climate instability`, `shifting sea
levels`, and `faunal dispersals which reflect much of today's
modern biota`. As it pertains to paleoanthropology, the Late Middle 
Pleistocene (hereafter LMP) hosts a minimum of three widely agreed 
upon hominin species: *Homo erectus* (1.8 Ma-`125 Ka`), *Homo 
neanderthalensis* (~440 ka - 30 Ka), and *Homo sapiens* (300 
Ka-present). In addition to these agreed upon taxa, `many scholars` 
recognize or argue for the existence of additional hominin species 
designations. These include common nomina such as *Homo 
heidelbergensis* as well as the even more contentious claims of 
*Homo naledi* and *Homo longi*. Further, while *Homo 
heidelbergensis* is a commonly referenced taxon, recent 
considerations have divided the assemblage into the already 
well-regarded *H. neanderthalensis* taxon throughout Europe and a 
new designation of *H. bodoensis* in Africa. The latter designation would also encapsulate the contended *H. rhodesiensis* named by Woodward in 1921.
